Considerations:

1) You need FreeCAD to open files with FCStd extension. I recommend 0.18 version or higher.
2) The full house model is divided into 3 main files: ...Decks file, ...Windows file, ...Core file.
3) To assemble the full model with the three main files, it is recommended to use the FreeCAD External Reference Tool https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Arch_Reference (do not move the model position in its individual file).
3) This is a work in progress. Changes and updates are expected.
